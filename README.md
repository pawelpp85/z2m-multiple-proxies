# Z2M Proxy Home Assistant Add-ons

Lightweight Home Assistant add-ons that only expose existing Zigbee2MQTT (Z2M) UI instances already running on your host (e.g., Docker containers). No Zigbee hardware or MQTT connectivity is provided here; each add-on is just an ingress-enabled reverse proxy so you can pin multiple Z2M dashboards in the sidebar.

This repository is derived from the official Zigbee2MQTT Home Assistant proxy add-on ([zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt](https://github.com/zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt)) and was fully generated by ChatGPT/Codex based on that project. Huge thanks to the Zigbee2MQTT authors and the proxy add-on maintainers for the foundation.

## Included proxies

- `zigbee2mqtt_one` (UI title: Zigbee2MQTT One): defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8099`
- `zigbee2mqtt_two` (UI title: Zigbee2MQTT Two): defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8099`
- `zigbee2mqtt_three` (UI title: Zigbee2MQTT Three): defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8099`
- `zigbee2mqtt_aggregated` (UI title: Zigbee2MQTT Aggregated): merges devices from multiple Z2M instances

Add more proxies by copying any of the proxy folders, adjusting the slug, panel title, and default `target_port`.

## Usage

1. Add this repository to Home Assistant as a custom add-on store.
2. Install the desired proxy add-on(s).
3. In each add-on configuration, set:
   - `server`: full URL of the existing Z2M UI **without a trailing slash** (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:8486`). A trailing `/` can break routing and show a blank page.
   - `auth_token` (optional): token to append to the query string (same behavior as the official proxy).
4. Start the add-on. The Z2M UI will appear via ingress under the configured panel title and icon. With ingress and `panel_title` set, Home Assistant normally shows it in the sidebar; if not, enable “Show in sidebar” in the add-on UI.

## Notes

- These add-ons run with `host_network: false` and rely on ingress. If you need host access to a URL on the supervisor network, keep using full URLs like `http://127.0.0.1:PORT`.
- Because they only proxy HTTP, they do **not** manage Zigbee adapters, MQTT, or state.
- Each add-on ships with its own ingress port (8099/8100/8101) for internal binding; no host port is exposed by default.
- Built from the Home Assistant base image with a tiny nginx reverse proxy.
